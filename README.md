# Customer-Churn-Prediction
The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn. Using demographic data (such as gender, senior citizen status, and tenure), along with information they use (such as internet service, phone service, and online security)

# Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a customer
will churn. Using demographic data (such as gender, senior citizen status, and tenure), along
with information about the services they use (such as internet service, phone service, and
online security), we will attempt to build a model that helps the company identify customers
who are at a high risk of churning.

#  Deliverables
● A data exploration and preprocessing notebook or report that analyzes the dataset,
handles missing values, and prepares the data for modeling.

● A machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn.

● An evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics (such as accuracy,
precision, recall, F1 score, etc.).

● A final, well-documented notebook detailing all steps, insights, and the final model
selection

# Tools Required
● Python (with libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)

● Jupyter Notebook or any IDE suitable for running Python code
