# Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a customer
will churn. Using demographic data (such as gender, senior citizen status, and tenure), along
with information about the services they use (such as internet service, phone service, and
online security), we will attempt to build a model that helps the company identify customers
who are at a high risk of churning.
